# Programming Exercises in Java
This repository contains a set of Java programs that were developed to practice and demonstrate Java programming concepts. Each program addresses a specific topic and the programs are organized into separate classes.

## Content
The repository is organized as follows:

- OpArit.java: This class contains examples of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

- OpLogi.java: This class contains examples of logical operations such as OR, AND, exclusive OR, and NOT operators.

- OpRela.java: This class contains examples of relational operations, such as equality, inequality, greater, less, greater or equal, and less than or equal.

- TP1_Exercicio1.java: This class contains examples of variable declaration and assignment.

- TP1_Exercicio2.java: This class contains example methods to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rectangle perimeter, rectangle area, cylinder volume and logical operations.

- TP1_Exercicio3.java: This class contains example methods for calculating the body adiposity index (BFI) and verifying a student's admission to the exam based on their grades.

- TP1_Exercicio4.java: This class contains example methods to calculate the factorial of a number using different control structures (while, do-while, for).

- TP1_Exercicio5.java: This class contains examples of one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.

- TP1_Exercicio7.java: This class contains examples of arithmetic, logical and relational operations in Java.
